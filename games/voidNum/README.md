voidNum is my "first game" project in C, I have been tampering with the idea of making a "terminal game" for a while; although, I am concious that it lacks in memory efficienty (with the use of several pre-built boards), function clarity and other features that could have been better impelemented. I also struggled with adding the timer feature (had to ask Copilot to manage the windows.h API and threads for me), but at last, I see this project as a "fun project" to challenge my problem-solving and organization abilities.

*This game only runs properly on Windows devices.
