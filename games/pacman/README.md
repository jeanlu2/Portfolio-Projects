A simple but effective Pacman clone made in C, for the terminal. Huge improvement from last game, this time around instead of constantly redrawing the board. I used ANSI codes to redraw only the parts that changed, essentially avoiding the screen-flickering and improving the overall feel of the game.

The ghosts AI and number of ghosts was changed from the original game, although they don't follow the same patterns, it makes for a challenging expierience. 

*The executable file is found in the "Releases" section of this repo. Take a look!

*Windows exclusive! (conio.h, windows.h...)
